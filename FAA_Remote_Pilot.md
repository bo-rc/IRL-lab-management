__night__: (sunset+30min, sunrise-30min)

FAA prohibits sUAS operation during night.
* unless COW

sUAS operation OK in twilight if equipped with anti-collision light visible from 3 statute miles.
* 1.15 statute miles = 1 mile
* momentary intensity reachs 3 statute miles

## 1.6 Visibility and cloud clearance requirement

_station visibility_ (on exam): 3 statute miles
_UAS obstables_ (on exam): 500ft below cloud and 2000ft horizontally from the cloud

keep visual line of sight.

momentary vision aid allowed.

## 1.7 Maxmum speed and altitute

* ground speed 87 knots (100 mph)
* 400ft Above Ground Level (AGL)
 * unless flying over 400ft radius of tall structure: +400ft of the tallest part.

## 1.8 Right of way rules

FPV can be used if see and avoid can be satisfied in other ways.

## 1.9 Operation over non-participants

Idealy: sparsely-populated area.
* If not, make a plan to protect bystanders
 * this is "other doc" refered by FAA

## 1.20 operate from a moving vehicle

## Part 107 vs. Hobbyist
sUAS registration
* you may register an empty LLC and list the UAS as a property of the LLC to protect against lawsuis. 

# 2 Airspaces

## Class B

Large and "B"usy airports, requires approval for sUAS.

Solid blue lines. Inverted wedding cake shape.

## Class C

Stepped-down size but still busy (UIUC Willard), requires approval for sUAS.

Solid magenta lines. Inverted wedding cake shape.

## Class D

Much smaller, requries approval for sUAS.

Dashed blue lines. Cylinder shape.

## Class E&G

Generally uncontrolled.

* Class G requires no prior approval for sUAS.
* surface Class E (Dashed magenta lines) requires approval for sUAS: it starts from the ground.
* typical Class E starts from 700ft or 1200ft (Faded magenta lines): part 107 sUAS do not apply.

## Other airspaces

Refer to FAA Chart.

## AGL vs. MSL

__AGL__: above ground level

__MSL__: mean see level
* FAA chart uses MSL.
 * one exeption: Faded magenta, Class E, uses AGL.

5-mile rule: only applies for hobbyists. 
* remote pilots can fly in any class G airspace without prior approval.

## Advanced airspace (on Exam)
* Class C: 20nm across
* Class D: usually extends up to 2500ft AGL
* MOA: military training activities that necessitate acrobatic or abrupt flight manuvers.
* Restricted: unusual, often invisible hazard to aircraft.
 * e.g. artillery firing, aerial gunnary, missles.
 
 * MRT: military training routes
  * height: 
    * four-digit, e.g. IR1202: 1500ft AGL and below
    * three-and-less digit, e.g. VR108, IR23: 1500ft AGL and above.
