## 1.9 Operation over non-participants

Idealy: sparsely-populated area.
* If not, make a plan to protect bystanders
 * this is "other doc" refered by FAA

## 1.20 operate from a moving vehicle

* allowd except from an aircraft

## Part 107 vs. Hobbyist
sUAS registration
* you may register an empty LLC and list the UAS as a property of the LLC to protect against lawsuis. 

# 2 Airspaces

## Class B

Large and "B"usy airports, requires approval for sUAS.

Solid blue lines. Inverted wedding cake shape.

## Class C

Stepped-down size but still busy (UIUC Willard), requires approval for sUAS.

Solid magenta lines. Inverted wedding cake shape.

## Class D

Much smaller, requries approval for sUAS.

Dashed blue lines. Cylinder shape.

## Class E&G

Generally uncontrolled.

* Class G requires no prior approval for sUAS.
* surface Class E (Dashed magenta lines) requires approval for sUAS: it starts from the ground.
* typical Class E starts from 700ft or 1200ft (Faded magenta lines): part 107 sUAS do not apply.

## Other airspaces

Refer to FAA Chart.

## AGL vs. MSL

__AGL__: above ground level

__MSL__: mean see level
* FAA chart uses MSL.
 * one exeption: Faded magenta, Class E, uses AGL.

5-mile rule: only applies for hobbyists. 
* remote pilots can fly in any class G airspace without prior approval.

## Advanced airspace (on Exam)
* Class C: 20nm across
* Class D: usually extends up to 2500ft AGL
* MOA: military training activities that necessitate ___low, acrobatic___ or abrupt flight manuvers.
* Restricted: unusual, often ___invisible hazard___ to aircraft.
 * e.g. artillery firing, aerial gunnary, missles.
 
Restricted area typically is surrounded by MOA.
 
 * MRT: military training routes
  * height: 
    * four-digit, e.g. IR1202: 1500ft AGL and below
    * three-and-less digit, e.g. VR108, IR23: 1500ft AGL and above.
    
 # 3 UAS weather and weather sources
 
## 3.1 METARs

_stands for_: Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report.


[METAR help](http://weather.cod.edu/notes/metar.html)

[Aviationweather.gov](http://aviationweather.gov/)

on-Exam: raw format of METAR needs to be translated to info.

## 3.2 TAFs

_stands for_: Terminal Aerodrome Forecast.

Extension to METAR and Forcast.

[Aviationweather.gov](http://aviationweather.gov/)

Typically valid for 24h.

1 knot = 1.15 mph.

## 3.3 HEMS Tools

_stands for_: Helicopter Emergency Medical Services.

Not on the exam but useful tool.

For low altitude (helicopters).

## 3.4 Weather briefs

[website](https://www.1800wxbrief.com/)

on exam: 3 types of weather briefs:
* standard: most complete weather briefing and for pilot who does not have an opportunity to gather any other weather data, gives the following information: adverse conditions VFR (Visual FLight Rules) flight not recommended Synopsis Current conditions, plus NOTAMs and TFRs.
* abbreviated: for pilot who needs to update previous weather data to complete weather picture.
* outlook: is requested by pilots whose departure time is 6 or more hours away.

## 3.5 Stable vs. unstable air (on exam)

__stable air__ characteristics:
* stratiform clouds (层云：low-level cloud characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, as opposed to convective or cumuliform clouds that are formed by rising thermals. foggy but not moving)
* fair to poor VIS
* continuous precipitation (precipitation at a constant and continuous rate)

__unstable air__ charactersitics:
* cumulus clouds (积云：look for building cumulus vertical clouds because air is moving)
* good VIS
* showery precipitation (precipitation falls inconsistently and would be defined as showery)

## 3.6 Surface friction

Affects low-flying sUAS.

## 3.7 Cloud formations and types

FAA classifications of Fogs: 

Close tempreture and dew point -> visible moisture: fog

__Radiation fog__

__Advection fog__

__Upslope fog__

__Precipitation induced fog/Steam fog__


FAA classification of clouds:

__low clouds__: 6,500ft and below
* stratus clouds
* cumulus clouds can also be low
* nimbostratus (nimbo: rain)
* cumulonimbus

__middle clouds__:
* altocumulus
* altostratus

__High clouds__:
* cirrus
* clouds with extension vertical development
* towering cumulonimbus

__lenticular cloud__:

## 3.8 Advanced Weather

SPECI METAR issued between METAR issue freqency when weather changes.

Fog vs. Frost.

__advection fog__: 


on exam: __Ceiling__: lowest broken or overcast cloud layer.

True vs. Magnetic winds
* rule of thumb is: If you read it, it is True. If you hear it, it is Magnetic.
* The automatic controll tower info. gives Magnetic.
* If you on a phone, the briefer gives you True because they just read it.

## 3.9 Flight Service and NOTAMs

If you have an approved waiver that requires a NOTAM, submit the NOTAM at [https://1800wxbrief.com/](https://1800wxbrief.com/) before your flight.


## 3.10 Advanced Weather 2

When will cloud or fog form?
* A: when water vapor condenses, becoming visible.


# 4. UAS loading and performance

## 4.1 Flying a payload

You should log the payload.

49 CFR part 171.8: harzadous needs waiver.

## 4.3 Performandce factors

__factors that may require a reduction in weight prior to flight include:
* high density altitude conditions
* high elevations
* high air temperatures
* high humidity
* Runway/luanch aera length
* surface
* slope
* surface wind
* presence of obstacles

## 4.4 Load factor

__load factor__: 

60<sup>o</sup> turn -> 2 G load factor.

## 5.2 Crew roles

CRM: Crew Resource Management.

The remote PIC identifies, delegates, and manages tasks for each sUAS operation.

## 5.3 Contingency procedures: what is your Plan B

Three steps contingency planning:
* Communicate with ATC
* What about airspace?
* Flight ternimation
 * Location: be located within power-off glide distance of the aircraft during all phases of flight
 * Undercoverable: be based on the assumption of an unrecoverable system failure
 * Environment: take into consideration altitude, winds, and other factors

## 5.4 Drugs and alcohol

Part 107 prohibits a person from serving as any sUAS crewmember if he or she:
* consumed any alcoholic beverage within the preceding 8 hours.
* is under the influence of alcohol
* has a blood alcohol concentration of .04% or greater
* is using a drug that affects the person's mental or physical capabilities
* including OTC drugs, e.g. sleep medicine.

Violation: 
1. Denial of an application for a remote pilot certificate with sUAS rating for a period of up to 1 year after the date of final conviction. Or
2. Suspension of a remote pilot certificate with a sUAS rating.

3 hours for metabolism to get rid of all the alcohol contained in one mixed drink or one beer.

## 5.5 Crew fatigue

Fatigue is an impaired state.

## 5.6 Hyperventilation (Over-breathing) & Stress Management

Use your common sense.

# 6. Airport/Field Operations

where to get NOTAMFs:
* weather briefs
* sUAS flight planning apps
* onlinie

[FAA NOTAM](https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/)


TFR: Temporary Flight Restrictions

[FAA TFR](http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html)

[Skyvector](https://skyvector.com/)


NOTAMs and TFRs are part of preflight check list.

## 6.2 Obstacles

AGL vs. MSL (Mean Sea Level)

You must be able to read FAA sectional charts.

How far you should stay away from a tower?
A: at least 2000ft.

## 6.3 Airport Traffic Patterns

Runways are numbered in reference to magnetic north. When you call a runway, planes are heading that number.

Planes usually do left turns.

on exam: Legs of traffic pattern:

## 6.4 FCC Frequencies

Open frequencies for sUAS: 2.4G Hz, 5.8G Hz.
